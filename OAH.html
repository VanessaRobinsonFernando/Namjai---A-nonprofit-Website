<p class="intro">Nam-jai offers support and guidance to senior citizens who don't have place to live. These elders are provided with a healthy diet and good nutritional food by our 
dietitian. They are also encouraged to do regular excersice and activity and therefore we have provided an outdoor area and a physiotherapist as an external health.
Our location is quite convenient in terms of getting medical health as well as any sort of transportation. </p>
