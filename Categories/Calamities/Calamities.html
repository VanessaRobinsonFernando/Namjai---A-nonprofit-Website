    <p class="design"><h2>Yemen Humanitarian Crisis</h2>Yemen was  hit by once-in-a generation flooding that affected more than 100,000 people, left thousands of people homeless and impacted 
       camps for IDPs. COVID-19’s arrival coincided with Yemen’s rainy season, which always brings the potential for cholera outbreaks. The 2019 
       cholera outbreak started during the rainy season and was the second-worst outbreak in global history; it is still not officially under control. 
       Despite the challenges posed by the humanitarian, health and safety situation in Yemen, people are still coming together to support each other.<br><br>

       The humanitarian crisis is due to different factors directly provoked by the conflict: extensive damage to infrastructure, economic collapse, 
       internal displacement, roadblocks and the breakdown of public services such as access to water, electricity, sanitation and health care. According to UN officials, 
       the cost of food has increased by 35 per cent in the last 12 months, and the Yemeni riyal has depreciated by 180 per cent. If the trend continues, 12 million people 
       will be at risk of starvation.<br><br>
 
       On 2 November 2018, the Associated Press published a report describing the lives of people forced to eat According to UN officialsto survive in a 
       district called Aslam, partially due to local authorities interfering with aid distribution and resisting requests to set up biometric registration for 
       those receiving assistance. Another family reported eating boiled leaves and moldy breadcrumbs. “We left everything behind. We walked for hours on foot, carrying 
       nothing, not even one riyal, no food or water,” said Yahia Hussein, whose five-month-old son died of starvation.

         island just before 1:30 a.m. local time on Jan. 15, 2021. This major earthquake was preceded by a nearby M5.7 foreshock the day before.<br><br>
         
         Approximately 12 hours earlier on the previous day, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck immediately northwest of the 
         mainshock, triggering multiple landslides and destroying two houses in Majene. The foreshock occurred at a depth of 19 km (12 mi) and 
         was located 4 km (2.5 mi) from Majene. Shaking was recorded in Majene with an intensity on the Mercalli intensity scale of V-VI 
         (Moderate to Strong),  The foreshock was felt as far away as South Kalimantan. The foreshock reportedly caused 26 aftershocks. 
          Dozens of people reportedly evacuated due to fears of a tsunami and one person was injured.

     <p class="design"><h2>Beirut Explosion</h2> In the early evening (local time) of Aug. 4, a fire, believed to be in a fireworks factory, led to two explosions in a warehouse 
   holding 3,030 U.S. tons (2,700 metric tons) of ammonium nitrate in the port area of Beirut, Lebanon. At the end of December, an FBI 
   investigation found that only 551 U.S. tons (500 metric tons) exploded. There have been no reports accounting for the rest of thefertilizers.<br><br>

   The blast destroyed the immediate dockside area, creating a crater approximately 140m (460ft) wide, which flooded with seawater.
   The warehouse where the initial fire and explosions were observed was obliterated and an adjacent grain silo was heavily damaged.
   Satellite images show complete devastation in the port area, with one ship apparently blown out of the water and onto the dockside.<br><br>

   The explosion's shockwave blew out windows at Beirut International Airport's passenger terminal, about 9km (5 miles) away from the port.
   The blast was also heard as far away as Cyprus, about 200km across the Mediterranean Sea, and seismologists at the United States Geological 
   Survey said it was the equivalent of a 3.3-magnitude earthquake.

     <p class="design"><h2>2021 Uttarakhand flood</h2>The 2021 Uttarakhand flood began on 7 February 2021 in the 
  environs of the Nanda Devi National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the outer Garhwal Himalayas in Uttarakhand state, India. 
  A tributary to the Dhauliganga River, was damaged and 35 laborers working on the project are missing.The district of Chamoli in 
  Uttarakhand appeared to have been hit hardest by the surging Dhauliganga River. <br><br>

  Many villages were earlier evacuated as authorities emptied two dams farther down the river to stop the floodwaters from reaching towns 
  of Haridwar and Rishikesh. Two C-130J Super Hercules with 3 teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have been deployed in 
  the rescue mission.According to the director-general of the NDRF, the rescue efforts could take up to 2 days.Emergency crews 
  managed to rescue 16 workers who had been trapped inside a tunnel. Another 35 to 40 workers are thought to be trapped in a second tunnel.
  At the Tapovan Vishnugad Hydropower Project site which is being built by the NTPC 5 km (3.1 mi) downstream, rescuers have been attempting 
  to cave their way into a tunnel to rescue at least 30 workers who were said to be trapped.

    <p class="design"><h2>Turbulent Tornadoes in Oklahoma City Area</h2> While Oklahoma's no stranger to tornadoes, a mile-wide EF5 tornado 
   ripped through parts of Newcastle, Moore and southern Oklahoma City on May 20, 2013, killing 24 people, damaging more than 300 homes 
   and becoming central Oklahoma's costliest single tornado, at an estimated $2 billion in damages. Eleven days later, a 2.6-mile 
   EF5 tornado – the widest tornado on record in the U.S. – killed eight people near El Reno, Oklahoma. Succeeding thunderstorms 
   then rolled over the metro area during rush hour, with flash flooding killing 13 people.<br><br>

   In addition to erroneous reports concerning the status of Briarwood and Plaza Towers students, various reports regarding fatality and 
   injury counts as well as persons unaccounted for were circulated by traditional and social media outlets in the immediate hours after the 
   tornado struck, which could not immediately be confirmed or refuted due to communications disruptions in the affected areas or were the 
   result of incorrect counting due to miscommunication of estimates.Within the first two days, it was reported that between and 
   240 people had been injured, with the tally later increasing to over 350.The final count of injuries was later adjusted downward to 212.<br><br>
 
   On the morning of May 21, the medical examiner's office incorrectly stated that 91 bodies of tornado victims had been received.This number was 
   up from the earlier report of 51 bodies that were incorrectly stated as having been received. Upon the office's discovery that some victims were 
   mistakenly counted twice due to communication errors made by Moore rescue response units that the bodies were admitted to area funeral homes 
   (nearly all of the deceased were actually transported to the examiner's office in Oklahoma City), the actual number was revised downward and 
   later confirmed at 24 tornado victims and two indirect victims.

     <p class="design"><h2>Hurricane Harvey</h2> While Hurricane Harvey caused widespread damage when it made 
   landfall as a Category 4 storm, its associated extreme rainfall produced historic flooding across Houston and surrounding areas 
   displaced more than 30,000 people and damaged or destroyed more than 200,000 homes and businesses. Harvey was the second-costliest 
   U.S. tropical hurricane on record, behind Hurricane Katrina in 2005.<br><br>

   The widespread and catastrophic effects of Hurricane Harvey resulted in one of the costliest natural disasters in United States history. 
   An estimated 300,000 structures and 500,000 vehicles were damaged or destroyed in Texas alone. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
   Administration estimated total damage at $125 billion, with a 90% confidence interval of $90–160 billion. The scope of flooding in areas 
   with low National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) participation lends to the large uncertainty in the damage total. This ranks Harvey as 
   the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the country alongside Hurricane Katrina in 2005. However, accounting for inflation and cost 
   increases since 2005, the National Hurricane Center considers Harvey the second-costliest.<br><br>

   Harvey was the costliest natural disaster recorded 
   in Texas at the time,until it was surpassed in February 2021 by a severe winter storm that crippled the state's power grid, which was estimated 
   to have cost at least $195 billion (2021 USD) in damages.Nationwide, 107 people died in storm-related incidents: 103 in Texas, 2 in Arkansas, 
   1 in Tennessee, and 1 in Kentucky. Of the deaths in Texas, 68 were from the direct effects of Harvey, the highest such number in the state since 1919.
